	Prepared by the Research Group on Earthquake Geology in Greece (http://eqgeogr.weebly.com/) Version 2 (updated) With the release of new Sentinel-2 images, and other available resources for the M7.8 Kaikoura earthquake, we present an update of the Map of Co-Seismic Landslides and Surfaces Ruptures (As of 27/11/2016). Landslides were mapped using Sentinel-2 satellite images from Copernicus, European Space Agency, dated November and December 2016. Images were visually compared with previous last available S2A images without cloud cover (13 September and 26 October) and landslides and large slope failures were manually mapped. Areas covered by cloud are omitted and shown on map. 5875 landslide sites are shown in the map. A small number of landslides could have been mis-identified due to insufficient resolution of the images, small gaps of cloud cover or for other reasons. Also, re-activated landslides on the central mountainous area were unabled to identify due to imagery restrictions (medium resolution, relief shadows etc). Some local gaps in Sentinel imagery still exist due to cloud cover, but we believe the current map is very close to the major distribution of mass movement effects. Surface ruptures were mapped using Sentinel-2 imagery and approximate position from photos of the post-earthquake aerial surveys of Environment Canterbury Regional Council (http://ecan.govt.nz) KML file contains7355 landslide spots.
