	We evaluate the total forage fish biomass available for aquaculture feed (i.e., supply) from the FAO total reported catches. We classify species in the database as 'forage fish' by excluding inland (freshwater) areas, selecting from only ISSCAAP 'marine fishes,' and extracting the respective maximum sizes from Fishbase. We set a cutoff of 1200g maximum weight (corresponding to a max length of approximatrely 50 cm) for fish included in the analysis. For species that were reported on the genus level, we use average maximum weight. Supplementary Table S1 includes the 20 highest catching forage fish in 2012 (last year of FAO forage fish fee estimates), comprising 71% of the total forage fish catch. In total we calculated the average catch (after 1980) of forage fish to be approximately 31 million tonnes per year, comprising about 38% of the global catch.
