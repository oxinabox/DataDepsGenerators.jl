	Abstract : This is a difficult regression task, where the aim is to predict the burned area of forest fires, in the northeast region of Portugal, by using meteorological and other data (see details at:  [Web Link] ).
	
	This dataset is public available for research. The details are described in [Cortez and Morais, 2007].
